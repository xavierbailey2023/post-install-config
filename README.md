<p>
Made 2 different agents and 1 system admin that would have access to osTicket.  Gave each user a username and password so they can log into osTicket.

</p>
<p>
Made different Service Level Agreements (SLA) and gave them different completion times so that it will be easy to determine which tickets have the highest and lowest importance. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Made different help topics so that when users create a ticket they can classify what they need help with.  This makes it easier for the helpdesk supervisor to assign tickets to the team that can best solve the problem.
